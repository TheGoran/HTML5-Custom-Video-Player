1.Make Volume slider with Bars deisgn - done

2.Make the video beginning to show as background instead of the black color or so.
        After some research of how to make  the video element background loading the first video frame when video loaded.
        Discovered that it can be done like this:
                <video  src="videos/streetperformers.mp4#t-0.1" id="video" class="screen" poster="img/play.png"></video>
        However, that hides the  Poster(play.png) button on start, and  apparently has compatibility issues on Apple devices where something show and something doesnt etc.
        So for that sake

3. Make the video Seek(progress) Bar shows preview of the frame at the point the mouse is hovering, same like on youtube.
   From the so far research, it seems the best way to achieve this without library is to use the CANVAS API for pulling the frame shots.
   Then will have to figure out how to position that above the mouse pointer, when it is above certain point on the Seek(progress) Bar.
   My initial guess is to do it in Tooltip style or so...will see, lets just make it pulls the frame shots first .
  

  Ok this is getting a bit tricky, have to do some deeper research.

  
4.  Add keyboard(Arrrow) controls for the Volume and scrolling through the video. 

5. Add Full Screen  button/functionality.
